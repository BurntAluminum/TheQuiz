#### By _Max Osborne_

## Description

_Like a "What Anime Girl are you?" Quiz but for coding, cept even worse: This doesn't even include an image saying you are overprotective and like burger. That's replaced with plain ol' boring text, but feel free to post that in your profile or something. I'm pretty proud _

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open the html file._
* _Take quiz._
* _Hit Radio Buttons until the selected text most suits you._
* _Hit Submit Button._
* _Become an Kawaii Anime Girl._

## Known Bugs

_You don't actually get to be a Kawaii Anime Girl. Life is Pain._

## Support and contact details

_Leave me alone, this will never be updated, fix it yourself._

## Technologies Used

_I used Atom, Bootstrap, JQuery, and JavaScript to make this._
